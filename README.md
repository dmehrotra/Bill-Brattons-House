Bratton's House is a protest against the expanding surveillance state and its corrosive effect on free speech. Tweet at @brattonsHouse to send Commisioner Bratton a photograph of his own house taken in real-time.

Bratton's House uses a raspberry pi to take photographs of the commissioner's house and send them via GSM to a remote server. Photographs are then tweeted to @commissBratton.

Bill Bratton is the current New York City Police Commissioner. He is known for his data driven approach to law enforcement.

Bratton serves as an advisor to the Department of Homeland Security along with the CEOs of various private security contractors like Booz Allen. This is significant because the DHS alone has awarded more than $38 billion in grants for various police departments to buy domestic spying equipment and military technology. Many times this technology is often supplied by corporations who Bratton has worked for or closely with. Eg. Motorola, Kroll, PredPol.

By leveraging U.A.S.I grants and terrorism concerns to purchase and deploy tools like drones, sting rays, automatic liscence plate readers, X-ray Vans and other military grade equipment, Bratton has adopted new surveillance technology without permission or real oversite.

This technology encourages police officers to view everyone with suspicion and furthers the repressive tendencies of state and local police. Under Bratton every-day citizens are treated like insurgents.

In 2008 Bratton and a team of researchers developed proprietary software called PredPol, a domestic intelligence gathering product. The software is based on predictive algorithms that are used to track insurgent activity in Iraq.

Bratton, was the first commissioner to adopt the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative. Suspicious Activity Reports, in theory are a means for reporting behavior that are considered “preoperational planning related to terrorism or other criminal activity.”. However in practice these reports often disproportionately target muslim males who engage in such dubious behavior as “ordering food at a restaurant . . . without eating”.

Though Bratton disbanded the demographics unit, his "data driven policing" has resulted in the targeting of Muslim groups by deploying informants and under cover officers to spy on law-abiding citizens.
